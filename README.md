BVS Site Importer - 2011
========================
 
This script imports the XML data of a BVS-Site 5.x to a XML_RPC structure that 
can be later imported into a Wordpress site customized with both BVS-Site and
Multi Language Framework plugins.

Instructions:
* Set the path to the XML BVS-Site directory in the $XML_DIRECTORY
* Set the language you want to import in the $LANGUAGE variable (in BVS-Sites
  with more than one language active the process should be done for each 
  language)
